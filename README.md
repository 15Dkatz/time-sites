#### Chrome extension to time usage of sites
This tracks usage of your most distracting sites. For me, that's Youtube and Facebook.
There used to be this great chrome extension called Chrome Nanny, but the maintainer
went into retirement. Drowning in the time-suck of Facebook and YouTube crept back in.

So I made this extension to replace Chrome Nanny and get more productive!

Try it yourself with the `run locally` steps below.

#### Run Locally:
* chrome://extensions
* Developer switch
* Load unpacked, and load in the project directory.
* Click open background console. Fire away!

#### TODOs:
 * Make the SITE_TIME_MAP editable by the user
 * add extension icons
